## 🚀 Our Mission

**Shyntr** is an open-source organization dedicated to redefining Identity and Access Management (IAM) for the era of AI and Zero Trust. We believe that identity is not just for humans anymore; it is the fundamental fabric connecting users, services, and autonomous agents.

We are building a protocol-agnostic, secure, and scalable ecosystem that unifies authentication traffic and prepares your infrastructure for the future of **Agentic AI**.

## 🛡️ Core Pillars

We focus our development efforts on three critical frontiers:

### 1. Protocol-Agnostic IAM (The Broker)
The foundation of our ecosystem. We bridge the gap between legacy protocols (SAML) and modern standards (OIDC/OAuth2).
* **Repo:** [`shyntr/shyntr`](https://github.com/Shyntr/shyntr)
* **Focus:** Multi-tenancy, Headless UI, Federation Gateway.

### 2. Zero Trust Architecture
"Never trust, always verify." Our solutions are designed with Zero Trust principles at the core, ensuring strict identity verification for every person and device accessing resources, regardless of location.

### 3. Agentic IAM (Identity for AI)
As AI agents become autonomous, they need distinct identities. We are pioneering **Agentic IAM** patterns to strictly manage, monitor, and authorize **Non-Human Identities (NHI)**.
* **Goal:** Securely issuing short-lived, scoped credentials for AI Agents to perform actions on behalf of users.
